# **Briefing on Adam-AI**  

Adam-AI is an **AI-powered executive assistant** designed to streamline business workflows, automate routine tasks, and integrate seamlessly with communication and productivity tools. The focus is on **efficiency, security, and privacy**, with a **local-first approach** to data processing.  

---

## **Core Objectives**  
1. **Task Automation** – Draft and send emails, manage meetings, summarize Slack/Teams messages, and handle document approvals.  
2. **Seamless Integration** – Connect with Outlook, Gmail, Slack, DocuSign, and other SaaS tools.  
3. **Real-Time Assistance** – Utilize **WebSockets** for real-time task execution and notifications.  
4. **Privacy & Security** – **Runs locally** or on a **self-hosted server** to avoid exposing sensitive business data.  
5. **Adaptability** – Uses **fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to personalize responses based on user data.

## **Technical Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (for a fast, responsive UI)  
- **Backend**: FastAPI (for API and WebSocket communication)  
- **AI Engine and Data Processing**: Mistral-Small-24B (fine-tuned for business-specific queries)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for structured data) + ChromaDB (for AI memory)  
- **Containerization**: Docker (for easy deployment across environments)

## **How Adam-AI Works**  
1. **User Inputs a Command** (e.g., "Schedule a call with John at 3 PM.")  
2. **Retrieves Context** from integrated apps (Calendar, Slack, Email, etc.).  
3. **Processes Request** using AI inference with Mistral-Small-24B.  
4. **Executes Action** via API integrations (sends email, schedules a meeting).  
5. **Provides Real-Time Updates** using WebSockets.

## **Development Priorities**  
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure quick response times even on low-end hardware.  
- **Scalability**: Allow multi-user and enterprise-wide deployment.  
- **Security-First Approach**: Data stays on-premise, with strict access controls.  

Adam-AI is built for executives who need an AI that **understands their workflows, automates their tasks, and operates securely within their company’s ecosystem**.
